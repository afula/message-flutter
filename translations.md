# FAQ

### How do I translate technical terms like "Single Sign On (SSO)" or "Matrix"?

In most cases, these do not need to be translated at all. If in doubt, feel free to open an issue or ask in [#syphon:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#syphon:matrix.org).

### Should I use formal or informal language?

Generally, informal language is preferred. A notable exception is any legal disclaimer/information.
