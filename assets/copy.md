### Short Description
A privacy focused matrix chat client


### Description
Syphon is privacy focused end-to-end encrypted capable matrix client aiming to feel comfortable and easy to use.

That means:
- end-to-end encryption for all available chats
- no analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- no third party APIs (Firebase, Facebook SDK, etc)
- opt-in only for all signs of presence (typing bubbles, read receipts, etc) 
- and much more

E2EE is working for direct chats and group chats, but until we have a third party security audit, we cannot recommend using Syphon where proven and independently verified security is required.

There's still a lot of work to be done for user experience, performance, and feature parity with everything in the Matrix ecosystem. We'll always be improving!

We’re hoping that you can see the vision of the app! Want to help out or send us feedback? Feel free to email us at hello@syphon.org
